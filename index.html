    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is the concept of creating a web experience that focuses primarily on building for content rather than the most advanced browsers. This is done by layering the product, with the richest amount of information being available on the base markup to provide a basic web experience, regardless of the user's device capabilities. From there, CSS is introduced for users who can benefit from it. Lastly, if all else is possible, users are offered the premium experience with JavaScript. With this strategy, the content is separated from all of the fancy applicable appendages.</p>
    <p>This strategy is important and applicable, especially with modern-day usage of technology. Almost everyone, whether weak or powerful, has some sort of technology. With this, it is imperative that everyone is able to have the most complete experience of your website, regardless of their circumstance. By making things like JavaScript that only enhance the experience rather than define it, you are making a product that is, at its worst, a good product for the user. Progressive enhancement is also safer, as trying to integrate and mash HTML, CSS, and JS together can be extremely unstable and fragile, as if one non-HTML piece breaks, your UI crumbles with it. With progressive enhancement, this is an eliminated worry, as your website should be able to stand alone with just HTML in the worst-case scenario.</p>
    <p><a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/its-about-time-i-tried-to-explain-what-progressive-enhancement-actually-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a site with good information on the subject.</a></p>

    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this final project. I think there is a lot to gain from the experience, especially on the UI generation front. As my project matured, I slowly began to find direction as to how I wanted my site to look and operate.</p>

    <p>I worked on a project relating to Skyrim, a video game that I really like, so I was very passionate and knowledgeable about the topic that I was presenting. It gave me a great idea of the general vibe that I was going for, and there were no websites like mine that I could research for color palettes, so I went with something that I thought was on brand. I really liked the intricate customizations the most. Making it to where hovering over buttons would show the “travel” symbol from the games and showing images, making purposeful font and color choices, and adding information that only players understood was really fun to create a unique and personalized design that I could really connect with.</p>

    <p>If I could do it all again, I think that I would definitely mess with the layout. It is very similar to the ones that we did in class, and I think that creating something more unique would definitely add a bit of personal flair that I would be proud of.</p>

    <p>The changes that I made according to my feedback were mostly based on imagery, element location, and button usage. I decided to incorporate all of these changes, as I changed the buttons to be both functional and useful to the user, rather than just pertaining to an outside link or an unnecessary about page. I also deleted the packing guide from the home page and moved it to the holds pages, as it made more sense for a packing list to be specialized for a location. Ultimately, I enjoyed this project a lot, and I hope that it isn’t the last website that I get to personalize and design.</p>
